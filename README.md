Project Description

This project aims to develop statistical methodology and tools for the assessment of pattern classifiers. Specifically, superivised binary pattern classifiers are trained and tested with finite datasets. We assess the performance of the classifier in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). We develop analytical methods to quantify the variability of the estimated AUC that accounts for randomness from both the finite training set and the finite test set.

Project Description

Proposed by Harrell, the C index or concordance C, is considered an overall measure of discrimination in survival analysis between a survival outcome that is possibly right censored and a predictive-score variable, which can represent a measured biomarker or a composite-score output from an algorithm that combines multiple biomarkers. This package aims to statistically compare two C indices with right-censored survival outcome, which commonly arise from a paired design and thus resulting two correlated C indices.
